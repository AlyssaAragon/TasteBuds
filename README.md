<h3>Abstract</h3>
TasteBuds is an innovative cooking application designed to enhance the user experience in meal planning and recipe discovery. The app allows users to swipe through recipes to easily save them to favorites and collaborate with friends to explore meal options. Additionally, TasteBuds allows syncing accounts with a roommate or significant other, enabling them to easily make meal-planning decisions by finding common meal interests.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
TasteBuds is an iOS application that matches recipes between a pair. The main feature is a swiping function through an index of recipes. After that, there is a page that displays all the recipes two users matched on; a page for a user’s personally liked recipes; a page for the recipes the user’s partner liked; and a user profile and cooked recipe feed. TasteBuds’ goal is to streamline the meal-planning process for couples and friends. In addition, TasteBuds is an accessible platform that factors into dietary restrictions. TasteBuds makes planning easy, so when people spend time together, all they have to focus on is the present act of cooking together. Our project aims to simplify meal planning for couples and friends. We offer them a platform to discover recipes and cater to their cravings and dietary needs. Our objective is to eliminate couples’ struggle in deciding what to cook together, a chore that leads to frustration and decision fatigue. Finding time to meal plan with a partner in a busy world can be challenging. TasteBuds simplifies decision-making, allowing users to find recipes at their own pace and helping couples discover meals that they will both love.
